# Machine-Learning
There are only a few main learning styles or learning models that an algorithm can have and weâ€™ll go through them here with a few examples of algorithms and problem types that they suit.
This taxonomy or way of organizing machine learning algorithms is useful because it forces you to think about the roles of the input data and the model preparation process and select one that is the most appropriate for your problem in order to get the best result.

1. This repository contains codes along with necessary data for various Machine Learning algorithms. These codes were written for practice purpose. I have tried to cover most of the supervised ML algorithms.<br/><br/>
2. The codes based on these algorithms have been implemented using Python's ScikitLearn library (sklearn).<br/><br/>
3. Some of these algorithms have also been implemented from scratch without using any ML libraries.
