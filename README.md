# Machine-Learning
This repository contains codes along with necessary data for various Machine Learning algorithms. These codes were written for practice purpose. I have tried to cover most of the supervised ML algorithms.<br/>
The codes based on these algorithms have been implemented using Python's ScikitLearn library (sklearn).<br/>
Some of these algorithms have also been implemented from scratch without using any ML libraries.
