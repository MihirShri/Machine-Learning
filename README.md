# Machine-Learning
1. This repository contains codes along with necessary data for various Machine Learning algorithms. These codes were written for practice purpose. I have tried to cover most of the supervised ML algorithms.<br/><br/>
2. The codes based on these algorithms have been implemented using Python's ScikitLearn library (sklearn).<br/><br/>
3. Some of these algorithms have also been implemented from scratch without using any ML libraries.
